## Do The Exercises

Use this list of notebooks as a suggested set of exercises for this stage. 

Use the "exercise" notebook as a sandbox where you can copy code from various quickstarts, run it, and write down your insights in an associated markdown (docs) cell. _Make sure you attribute data and honor license or usage requirements_. Create a recipe book you can revisit later, to recall solutions.
