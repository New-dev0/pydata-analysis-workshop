# Python Data Analysis

## Introduction

This repository provides the source code and documentation for the **Python Data Analysis** workshop associated with the following talks:

 - Nov 2023 | Simplifying Data Analysis with GitHub Codespaces - [**PyData NYC**](https://speakerdeck.com/nitya/simplifying-data-analysis-with-github-codespaces-jupyter-notebooks-and-open-ai)
 - Mar 2024 | Simplifying Data Analysis with Developer Tools & AI - **Data Science Day** 

 The talk and workshop are meant for the _non-Python developer_ who wants to skill up in data science, and specifically in data analysis and visualization techniques_ without having had any formal training or experience in the subject. The goal is to help such learners get productive quickly, and in a goal-oriented manner, by leveraging the latest tools and techniques available in the developer ecosystem - _along with some generative AI assistance_.

## Pre-Requisites
  - Familiarity with GitHub and Visual Studio Code
  - Familiarity with at least one high-level programming language
  - Access to an OpenAI or Azure OpenAI key - optional, for Project LIDA
  - Access to a GitHub Copilot enabled account - optional, for AI-assisted learning
  - Knowledge of Python and Jupyter Notebooks is a plus
  - Having a specific data set or data analysis problem to work on is a plus

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

 - **Describe** what the various tools do, and why they matter
 - **Setup** a reusable development environment - with GitHub Codespaces
 - **Document** your learning with code - with Jupyter Notebooks
 - **Generate** notebooks and explore unfamiliar code - with GitHub Copilot
 - **Discover**, analyze and visualize open datasets - from Kaggle, Hugging Face or Azure
 - **Train & debug** models for responsible AI practices - with Responsible AI Toolbox
 - **Build intuition** and explore data visualizations - with Project LIDA
 - **Explore paradigm shift** to LLM Ops - with Azure AI Studio

## Summary

Here are the main tools we will cover, with links to relevant documentation and a short description on why they are useful.
