# PyData Workshop 2023

## Learning Objectives

- Use Jupyter Notebooks for transferable learning.
- Use GitHub Codespaces as a consistent dev environment.
- Use GitHub Copilot as a focused-learning assistant.
- Use Microsoft LIDA as an intuition-building assistant.
- Apply learnings and process to tackle challenges in:
    - Competitive Programming
    - Data Visualization
    - Prompt Engineering
    - and more ..

## Pre-Requisites 

 - GitHub Account
 - GitHub Codespaces (free quota is enough)
 - Kaggle Dataset (or bring your own)
 - GitHub Copilot (optional)
 - OpenAI API Key (optional)

The "optional" items are elements that require a paid subscription if you want to explore these on your own. I hope to add recorded walkthroughs of the exercises later, to provide coverage of those capabilities for those who don't have one.
